       " 'Introduction\\n\\n\\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was\\nexpounding a recondite matter to us.',\n",
       " 'His pale grey eyes shone and\\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated.',\n",
       " 'The fire\\nburnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the\\nlilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our\\nglasses.',\n",
       " 'Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather\\nthan submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious\\nafter-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the\\ntrammels of precision.',\n",
       " 'And he put it to us in this way—marking the\\npoints with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his\\nearnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.',\n",
       " '“You must follow me carefully.',\n",
       " 'I shall have to controvert one or two\\nideas that are almost universally accepted.',\n",
       " 'The geometry, for instance,\\nthey taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”\\n\\n“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said\\nFilby, an argumentative person with red hair.',\n",
       " '“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground\\nfor it.',\n",
       " 'You will soon admit as much as I need from you.',\n",
       " 'You know of\\ncourse that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real\\nexistence.',\n",
       " 'They taught you that?',\n",
       " 'Neither has a mathematical plane.',\n",
       " 'These things are mere abstractions.”\\n\\n“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.',\n",
       " '“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a\\nreal existence.”\\n\\n“There I object,” said Filby.',\n",
       " '“Of course a solid body may exist.',\n",
       " 'All\\nreal things—”\\n\\n“So most people think.',\n",
       " 'But wait a moment.',\n",
       " 'Can an _instantaneous_ cube\\nexist?”\\n\\n“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.',\n",
       " '“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\\nexistence?”\\n\\nFilby became pensive.',\n",
       " '“Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any\\nreal body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have\\nLength, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration.',\n",
       " 'But through a natural\\ninfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we\\nincline to overlook this fact.',\n",
       " 'There are really four dimensions, three\\nwhich we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.',\n",
       " 'There is,\\nhowever, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former\\nthree dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our\\nconsciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter\\nfrom the beginning to the end of our lives.”\\n\\n“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his\\ncigar over the lamp; “that .',\n",
       " '.',\n",
       " '.',\n",
       " 'very clear indeed.”\\n\\n“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,”\\ncontinued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.',\n",
       " '“Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some\\npeople who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it.',\n",
       " 'It\\nis only another way of looking at Time.',\n",
       " '_There is no difference between\\nTime and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our\\nconsciousness moves along it_.',\n",
       " 'But some foolish people have got hold of\\nthe wrong side of that idea.',\n",
       " 'You have all heard what they have to say\\nabout this Fourth Dimension?”\\n\\n“_I_ have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.',\n",
       " '“It is simply this.',\n",
       " 'That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,\\nBreadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three\\nplanes, each at right angles to the others.',\n",
       " 'But some philosophical\\npeople have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not\\nanother direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even\\ntried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry.',\n",
       " 'Professor Simon Newcomb\\nwas expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month\\nor so ago.',\n",
       " 'You know how on a flat surface, which has only two\\ndimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and\\nsimilarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could\\nrepresent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the\\nthing.',\n",
       " 'See?”\\n\\n“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,\\nhe lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who\\nrepeats mystic words.',\n",
       " '“Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some\\ntime, brightening in a quite transitory manner.',\n",
       " '“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry\\nof Four Dimensions for some time.',\n",
       " 'Some of my results are curious.',\n",
       " 'For\\ninstance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at\\nfifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on.',\n",
       " 'All\\nthese are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional\\nrepresentations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and\\nunalterable thing.',\n",
       " '“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time\\nis only a kind of Space.',\n",
       " 'Here is a popular scientific diagram, a\\nweather record.',\n",
       " 'This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of\\nthe barometer.',\n",
       " 'Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then\\nthis morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here.',\n",
       " 'Surely the\\nmercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space\\ngenerally recognised?',\n",
       " 'But certainly it traced such a line, and that\\nline, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”\\n\\n“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if\\nTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has\\nit always been, regarded as something different?',\n",
       " 'And why cannot we move\\nin Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”\\n\\nThe Time Traveller smiled.',\n",
       " '“Are you so sure we can move freely in\\nSpace?',\n",
       " 'Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\\nand men always have done so.',\n",
       " 'I admit we move freely in two dimensions.',\n",
       " 'But how about up and down?',\n",
       " 'Gravitation limits us there.”\\n\\n“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man.',\n",
       " '“There are balloons.”\\n\\n“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”\\n\\n“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.',\n",
       " '“Easier, far easier down than up.”\\n\\n“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\\npresent moment.”\\n\\n“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong.',\n",
       " 'That is just where the\\nwhole world has gone wrong.',\n",
       " 'We are always getting away from the present\\nmoment.',\n",
       " 'Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no\\ndimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform\\nvelocity from the cradle to the grave.',\n",
       " 'Just as we should travel _down_\\nif we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”\\n\\n“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist.',\n",
       " '’You\\n_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about\\nin Time.”\\n\\n“That is the germ of my great discovery.',\n",
       " 'But you are wrong to say that\\nwe cannot move about in Time.',\n",
       " 'For instance, if I am recalling an\\nincident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I\\nbecome absent-minded, as you say.',\n",
       " 'I jump back for a moment.',\n",
       " 'Of course\\nwe have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than\\na savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground.',\n",
       " 'But a\\ncivilised man is better off than the savage in this respect.',\n",
       " 'He can go\\nup against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that\\nultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the\\nTime-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”\\n\\n“Oh, _this_,” began Filby, “is all—”\\n\\n“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.',\n",
       " '“It’s against reason,” said Filby.',\n",
       " '“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.',\n",
       " '“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will\\nnever convince me.”\\n\\n“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller.',\n",
       " '“But now you begin to see the\\nobject of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions.',\n",
       " 'Long\\nago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”\\n\\n“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.',\n",
       " '“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as\\nthe driver determines.”\\n\\nFilby contented himself with laughter.',\n",
       " '“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.',\n",
       " '“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist\\nsuggested.',\n",
       " '“One might travel back and verify the accepted account of\\nthe Battle of Hastings, for instance!”\\n\\n“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man.',\n",
       " '“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”\\n\\n“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the\\nVery Young Man thought.',\n",
       " '“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.',\n",
       " 'The\\nGerman scholars have improved Greek so much.”\\n\\n“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man.',\n",
       " '“Just think!',\n",
       " 'One\\nmight invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and\\nhurry on ahead!”\\n\\n“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic\\nbasis.”\\n\\n“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.',\n",
       " '“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”\\n\\n“Experimental verification!” cried I.',\n",
       " '“You are going to verify _that_?”\\n\\n“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.',\n",
       " '“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s\\nall humbug, you know.”\\n\\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us.',\n",
       " 'Then, still smiling faintly, and\\nwith his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of\\nthe room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to\\nhis laboratory.',\n",
       " 'The Psychologist looked at us.',\n",
       " '“I wonder what he’s got?”\\n\\n“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby\\ntried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he\\nhad finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s\\nanecdote collapsed.',\n",
       " 'II.',\n",
       " 'The Machine\\n\\n\\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic\\nframework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately\\nmade.',\n",
       " 'There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline\\nsubstance.',\n",
       " 'And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his\\nexplanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing.',\n",
       " 'He\\ntook one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the\\nroom, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug.',\n",
       " 'On this table he placed the mechanism.',\n",
       " 'Then he drew up a chair, and sat\\ndown.',\n",
       " 'The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the\\nbright light of which fell upon the model.',\n",
       " 'There were also perhaps a\\ndozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and\\nseveral in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated.',\n",
       " 'I sat\\nin a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to\\nbe almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace.',\n",
       " 'Filby sat\\nbehind him, looking over his shoulder.',\n",
       " 'The Medical Man and the\\nProvincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the\\nPsychologist from the left.',\n",
       " 'The Very Young Man stood behind the\\nPsychologist.',\n",
       " 'We were all on the alert.',\n",
       " 'It appears incredible to me\\nthat any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly\\ndone, could have been played upon us under these conditions.',\n",
       " 'The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism.',\n",
       " '“Well?”\\nsaid the Psychologist.',\n",
       " '“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon\\nthe table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only\\na model.',\n",
       " 'It is my plan for a machine to travel through time.',\n",
       " 'You will\\nnotice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd\\ntwinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way\\nunreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger.',\n",
       " '“Also, here is one\\nlittle white lever, and here is another.”\\n\\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.',\n",
       " '“It’s beautifully made,” he said.',\n",
       " '“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller.',\n",
       " 'Then, when we\\nhad all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want\\nyou clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends\\nthe machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the\\nmotion.',\n",
       " 'This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.',\n",
       " 'Presently\\nI am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go.',\n",
       " 'It will\\nvanish, pass into future Time, and disappear.',\n",
       " 'Have a good look at the\\nthing.',\n",
       " 'Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no\\ntrickery.',\n",
       " 'I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a\\nquack.”\\n\\nThere was a minute’s pause perhaps.',\n",
       " 'The Psychologist seemed about to\\nspeak to me, but changed his mind.',\n",
       " 'Then the Time Traveller put forth\\nhis finger towards the lever.',\n",
       " '“No,” he said suddenly.',\n",
       " '“Lend me your\\nhand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand\\nin his own and told him to put out his forefinger.',\n",
       " 'So that it was the\\nPsychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its\\ninterminable voyage.',\n",
       " 'We all saw the lever turn.',\n",
       " 'I am absolutely certain\\nthere was no trickery.',\n",
       " 'There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame\\njumped.',\n",
       " 'One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little\\nmachine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost\\nfor a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;\\nand it was gone—vanished!',\n",
       " 'Save for the lamp the table was bare.',\n",
       " 'Everyone was silent for a minute.',\n",
       " 'Then Filby said he was damned.',\n",
       " 'The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under\\nthe table.',\n",
       " 'At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.',\n",
       " '“Well?” he\\nsaid, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist.',\n",
       " 'Then, getting up, he\\nwent to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to\\nfill his pipe.',\n",
       " 'We stared at each other.',\n",
       " '“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in\\nearnest about this?',\n",
       " 'Do you seriously believe that that machine has\\ntravelled into time?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the\\nfire.',\n",
       " 'Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s\\nface.',\n",
       " '(The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped\\nhimself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)',\n",
       " '“What is more, I have\\na big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the\\nlaboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on\\nmy own account.”\\n\\n“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said\\nFilby.',\n",
       " '“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”\\n\\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration.',\n",
       " '“It must have\\ngone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said.',\n",
       " '“Why?” said the Time Traveller.',\n",
       " '“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled\\ninto the future it would still be here all this time, since it must\\nhave travelled through this time.”\\n\\n“But,” said I, “If it travelled into the past it would have been\\nvisible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we\\nwere here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!”\\n\\n“Serious objections,” remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of\\nimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.',\n",
       " '“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: “You\\nthink.',\n",
       " '_You_ can explain that.',\n",
       " 'It’s presentation below the threshold,\\nyou know, diluted presentation.”\\n\\n“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us.',\n",
       " '“That’s a simple\\npoint of psychology.',\n",
       " 'I should have thought of it.',\n",
       " 'It’s plain enough,\\nand helps the paradox delightfully.',\n",
       " 'We cannot see it, nor can we\\nappreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel\\nspinning, or a bullet flying through the air.',\n",
       " 'If it is travelling\\nthrough time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it\\ngets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it\\ncreates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it\\nwould make if it were not travelling in time.',\n",
       " 'That’s plain enough.” He\\npassed his hand through the space in which the machine had been.',\n",
       " '“You\\nsee?” he said, laughing.',\n",
       " 'We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so.',\n",
       " 'Then the Time\\nTraveller asked us what we thought of it all.',\n",
       " '“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait\\nuntil tomorrow.',\n",
       " 'Wait for the common sense of the morning.”\\n\\n“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time\\nTraveller.',\n",
       " 'And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way\\ndown the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory.',\n",
       " 'I remember vividly\\nthe flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of\\nthe shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how\\nthere in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little\\nmechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes.',\n",
       " 'Parts were of\\nnickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of\\nrock crystal.',\n",
       " 'The thing was generally complete, but the twisted\\ncrystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of\\ndrawings, and I took one up for a better look at it.',\n",
       " 'Quartz it seemed\\nto be.',\n",
       " '“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you perfectly serious?',\n",
       " 'Or is\\nthis a trick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”\\n\\n“Upon that machine,” said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft,\\n“I intend to explore time.',\n",
